It's been almost 2 months and I'm not even done with Ruby Tic Tac Toe. I had set a goal to do 2 hours a day every day but I haven't quite stuck to it. I'm quite aware that in a self-paced course like this that means the only person I'm actually disappointing is myself. I thought about it recently and I realized I should approach this the same way I do exercising or brushing my teeth. It sounds strange, but these things are good for me, and learning to code in a steady, consistent manner would be beneficial in a similar way. Provided I can create a schedule and stick to it. Same with these blog posts. I'm going to try to pick up the slack, I know I have the time. Often the issue is having the mental energy, especially after a long day of work. But I know it's not impossible, or thousands of people wouldn't be doing this program.
